# 📌 Project Overview

**Drag Sail AI** is an AI-powered orbital sustainability platform developed by **COSMIC TEAM** for the **IEEE AESS Sustainability Hackathon 2026**.

The project predicts:
- 🛰️ Natural orbital decay time
- ⚠️ Space debris collision risk
- 🌍 Sustainability impact
- 🚀 Optimal drag sail deployment strategy

using real orbital mechanics data and machine learning models.

The goal is to support safer and cleaner Low Earth Orbit (LEO) operations through intelligent deorbit recommendations.

# 🌍 Problem Statement

Space debris is one of the fastest-growing threats to future space missions.

Currently orbiting Earth:
- **37,000+ tracked debris objects**
- **100+ million small fragments**
- Thousands of inactive satellites and rocket bodies

Even tiny debris travels at:
- ~7–8 km/s
- Faster than a bullet

This creates major risks for:
- Operational satellites
- Space stations
- Future launches
- Astronaut safety

Without mitigation, orbital congestion may trigger the **Kessler Syndrome**, where collisions generate more debris and make orbit unusable.

# 🧠 Proposed Solution

Drag Sail AI combines:
- Orbital mechanics
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning
- Sustainability-focused decision systems

to estimate:

| Output | Description |
|---|---|
| `natural_deorbit_years` | Estimated natural orbital lifetime |
| `risk_score` | Predicted orbital collision risk |
| `risk_level` | LOW → CRITICAL classification |
| `recommended_action` | Suggested drag sail action |
| `sail_deorbit_years` | Lifetime after sail deployment |
| `years_saved` | Reduction in orbital lifetime |
